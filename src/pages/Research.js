          <h1>2022-2023 Project</h1>
          <p>
            BMES R&D provides an opportunity for students to learn various
            technical ans soft skills in the field of biomedical engineering and
            it's related disciplines. These skills are often used in many of the
            upper level classes, such as MATLAB programming, Arduino coding and
            circuit design, signal aquisition and noise reduction, teamwork and
            communication, and general anatomy and physiology, among others. For
            Engineering Expo, each project is carefully catered to the audience
            of young children and teens, with the hope of teaching and inspiring
            them to be more involved and interested in STEM. For more

          <h1>2022-2023 Competitive</h1>
          <p>
            For the 2022-2023 year, the Competitive Research and Development VEX
            U team will work together to complete the next VEX challenge. This
            challenge, or "Spin Up", consists of a primary objective to shoot
            foam disks into elevated goals, or high goals, on corners to the
            playing field. The teams will have two robots each, and can earn
            points by not only shooting the disks, but also by spinning rollers,
            and building the robotrs to expand on the field. We will be
            utilizing metal materials (aluminum channels and plates, screws,
            etc), motors, the VEXCode V5 software and other advanced materials
            to build our robots. Our goal is to make it as fas as we can in the
            VEC Championships. This is a safe learning environment and everyone
            is expected to be helpful and accepting towards each other. For more
            information, contact the Research and Development Competitive Chair
            Sachita.
